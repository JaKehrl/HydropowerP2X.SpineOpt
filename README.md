This thesis presents a comprehensive techno-economic assessment of a Power-to-Ammonia
(P2A) project using hydropower as an energy source. The study focuses on the hydropower
resource of 7e lake Tasersiaq in West Greenland in an off-grid and remote setting. Through
the use of the SpineOpt energy system modelling framework, the feasibility of the system
is demonstrated and the optimal size and configuration of the P2A system is determined.

The study addresses key factors that influence the feasibility of the P2A system, including
component efficiency and water inflow. In addition, financial assumptions, including the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC), have a significant impact on the levelized cost
of ammonia (LCOA) and return on investment [%] (ROI). To account for the uncertainty
of future water inflows three scenarios in the form of dry, normal and wet years are derived
and the uncertainty of these water inflows is included in an extended stochastic model.
This results in two investment scales: a 670 MW hydropower plant for shares of less than
30% in wet years and a 862 MW hydropower plant for shares of 30% or more in wet years,
showing that while there is an increase in the LCOA due to higher investment cost, larger
increases in profits outweigh these additional investments.

The results of the study reveal important insights. Firstly, intermediate storages for
hydrogen and nitrogen are not recommended, as the water storage itself acts as a flexible
storage system. Secondly, constant operation to ensure a high utilisation rate is preferred,
with deviations only justified in case of extreme differences in ammonia market prices.
The projectâ€™s impact, evaluated through a triple bottom line impact assessment, reveals
potential benefits in social, economic, and environmental aspects. Recommendations for
future research include conducting simulations over several years to extensively evaluate
the performance and potential of the system.



The presentation provides a comprehensive overview of what has been done in the research and explains the deterministic
and stochastic model. The visualization model has been used to generate standardized data output that then was
displayed in a Power BI dashboard.
